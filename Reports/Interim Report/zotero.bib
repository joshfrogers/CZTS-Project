	title = {Picosecond studies of excited states in conjugated polymers},
	abstract = {This thesis reports on the interplay between molecular structure and photophysics in light emitting conjugated polymers revealed by steady state and picosecond time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy. The fundamental excited state relaxation of a polyfluorene derivative is compared to that of two oligofluorenes using isolated molecules in dilute solution. Their long-time time-dependent spectral dynamics are monitored by means of picosecond streak camera and single photon counting techniques. Excited state relaxation in oligofluorenes is entirely conformational and depends on solvent viscosity. The intrachain photophysics of the polyfluorene is dominated by fast excitation migration with a slow conformational component. A rigid ladder-type polymer exhibits only migrational relaxation. In analogy, the spectral dynamics of an alkoxy-substituted polyspirobifluorene are studied in dilute solution. Their qualitative dependence on solvent viscosity is elucidated by further femtosecond photobleaching measurements. Two excited states are proposed with the lower energy state involving strong spiroconjugation as confirmed by electronic structure calculations. Conversion between them occurs via conformational relaxation of the fluorene side groups. The sensitive reaction of these photophysics to the substitution pattern of the polymer suggests an easy chemical tunability of polyspirobifluorenes towards optimised charge carrier transport properties. Finally, the formation of the beta phase in amorphous polydioctylfluorene is investigated as a function of spin coating fabrication in the solid state. It is suggested that it forms by condensation at colloidal sites, which arise from incomplete solvation in the master solution. A further room temperature phase exists in the absence of these nuclei. The excited state relaxation after energy transfer from amorphous to beta phase is monitored via time-resolved spectroscopy. Within the beta phase, exciton migration is restricted as confirmed by steady state anisotropy data. This evidence for exciton confinement is an important step towards the application of the beta phase as a polymer laser.},

	title = {Study of Triplet Exciton Dynamics in Small Organic Molecule Films Using Time Resolved Optical Spectroscopy},
	url = {http://etheses.dur.ac.uk/495/},
	abstract = {In recent years it has become clear that knowledge of triplet transport in single layer and multilayer films can be crucial in improving the efficiency of organic light emitting devices and solar cells. This thesis reports an investigation of triplet exciton dynamics in small organic molecule single and multilayer layer films using optical time resolved nanosecond spectroscopy. A diligent step by step approach, leading towards the investigation of complex donor/spacer/acceptor multilayer structures is used. First of all, single layer films to be a constituents of multilayer structures were studied by measuring fluorescence, delayed fluorescence and phosphorescence. 4,4’-{N,N’-dicarbazolyl-1},1’-biphenyl ({CBP)} widely used in organic light emitting diodes is characterized. Evidence is provided that in some of these spectra emission comes from trap states rather than the {CBP} molecule itself. Also {N,N’-diphenyl-N}{,N’-bis(1-naphthyl)-1},1’-biphenyl-4,4’’-diamine ({NPB)} has been investigated. Results indicate that bimolecular triplet recombination is dominant and that triplet transport has dispersive features even at room temperature in {NPB} films. Then films of heavy metal iridium complexes fac-tris(2-phenylpyridine) iridium (Ir(ppy)3) and iridium({III)tris(1-phenylisoquinoline)} (Ir(piq)3) are put into the spotlight. New states previously not reported are identified and decay with the slope -1 characteristic of more than one iridium complex and previously not published in literature is observed. Triplet interface sites in bilayer Ir({piq)3/NPB} films obstructing triplet migration are determined and triplet movement across interface is experimentally captured for the first time. The origin of these interface trap states is suggested. Then this system is upgraded into Ir({ppy)3/NPB/Ir(piq)3} and triplet transfer from Ir(ppy)3 to Ir(piq)3 via {NPB} is investigated. A model of triplet exciton dynamics in Ir({piq)3/NPB} films using classical diffusion equations is presented with interface sites included. Computer simulations were performed and the results are in very good agreement with the experimental ones. Finally problems encountered are identified and main guidelines on how to do research in complicated multilayer structures are set.},
