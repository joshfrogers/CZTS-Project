        The intermixing of stannite and kesterite, i.e. Cu2Fe1?xZnxSnS4, was investigated by a combination of neutron and X-ray powder diffraction. Samples with 0 ? × ? 1 were synthesized by a solid state reaction of the pure elements in evacuated silica tubes at 750°C and quenched after the final annealing. The lattice parameter, cation site occupancies and the isotropic temperature factors were determined by simultaneously Rietveld analysis of X-ray and neutron powder diffraction data. The refined lattice constants are in agreement with the literature. The refined site occupancy factors were used to determine the average neutron scattering length of the cation sites in stannite, kesterite and Cu2Fe1?xZnxSnS4 solid solutions, giving new insight into the cation distribution. For Cu2FeSnS4 the stannite type cation ordering was approved, whereas a new ordering was obtained in Cu2ZnSnS4. In the latter Cu occupies the 2a site, Zn and the remaining Cu are disordered on 2c (0, ½, ¼) and 2d (0, ¼, ¾). The disorder may be due to sample synthesis, i.e. to the quenching of the samples. The cross-over from stannite to kesterite by Fe2+ ? Zn2+ substitution in the Cu2Fe1?xZnxSnS4 solid solution can be foreseen as a 3-stage process of cation exchange among the positions at (0, 0, 0), (0, ½, ¼) and (0, ¼, ¾), including Cu+, Zn2+ and Fe2+. The Sn4+ cation does not take part in this process and remains on the 2b site. Moreover the crossover is also visible in the ratio of the lattice parameter c/(2a), showing a characteristic dependence on chemical composition.The refined isotropic temperature factors were also taken into account. They give a consistent picture and to a degree support the developed cation distribution.

abstract = {Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) absorbers have been grown on Mo-coated glass substrates by the rapid thermal processing (RTP) sulfurization of stacked metallic precursor (CZT) films at different annealing temperatures ranging from 500 to 580°C for 5min in sulfur atmosphere. The effects of sulfurization temperature on the structural, morphological, chemical, and optical properties of the CZTS absorbers have been investigated. XRD and Raman studies reveal that the as-deposited stacked metallic precursor films consist of metal elements such as Zn, Sn and binary alloys such as Cu6Sn5, Cu3Sn and CuZn. The sulfurized CZTS absorber films have single phase polycrystalline kesterite crystal structure with dense morphology. At 580°C, the CZT metallic precursor film is fully sulfurized with Zn-rich and Sn-poor composition, and its bandgap energy is found to be 1.50eV. The solar cell fabricated with the CZTS absorber grown at an optimized sulfurization temperature of 580°C shows a conversion efficiency of \~{}5\% for a 0.44cm2 area with Voc=561mV, Jsc=18.4mA/cm2, and FF=48.2.},

abstract = {Starting from pure metals and sulphur in evacuated silica tubes single crystals of Cu8Ni4Sn12S32 have been obtained by heating at 750°C. It crystallizes in the Fd3m space group with Z=1 and a=10.3022 (6) \AA. The atomic parameters and anisotropic thermal parameters were refined to give a final R value of 0.0157. The mode of filling of tetrahedral and octahedral cavities of the anionic close packing has been analyzed taking their sizes into account. The difference in space groups for the analogous Fe and Cd thiospinels (I41/a) compared to that of the title compound (Fd3m) appears to be due to the larger size of the Fe2+ (HS) and Cd2+ ions leading to distorted octahedra. Cu8Ni4Sn12S32 shows semiconducting behavior with resistivity of 102 $\Omega$-cm at room temperature with a small band gap (∼0.05 eV).},

From the optical properties, we estimate the band-gap energy of this thin film as 1.45–1.6eV which is quite close to the optimum value for a solar cell. By using this thin film as an absorber layer, we could fabricate a new type of thin film solar cell, which was composed of Al/ZnO:Al/CdS/CZTS/Mo-SLG. The best conversion efficiency achieved in our study was 2.62\% and the highest open-circuit voltage was 735mV. These device results are the best reported so far for CZTS.},

abstract = {The best CZTS solar cell so far was produced by co-sputtering continued with vapour phase sulfurization method. Efficiencies of up to 5.74\% were reached by Katagiri et al. The one step electrochemical deposition of copper, zinc, tin and subsequent sulfurization is an alternative fabrication technique for the production of Cu2ZnSnS4 based thin film solar cells. A kesterite based solar cell (size 0.5 cm2) with a conversion efficiency of 3.4\% (AM1.5) was produced by vapour phase sulfurization of co-electroplated Cu–Zn–Sn films. We report on results of in-situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments during crystallisation of kesterite thin films from electrochemically co-deposited metal films. The kesterite crystallisation is completed by the solid state reaction of Cu2SnS3 and ZnS. The measurements show two different reaction paths depending on the metal ratios in the as deposited films. In copper-rich metal films Cu3Sn and CuZn were found after electrodeposition. In copper-poor or near stoichiometric precursors additional Cu6Sn5 and Sn phases were detected. The formation mechanism of Cu2SnS3 involves the binary sulphides Cu2−xS and SnS2 in the absence of the binary precursor phase Cu6Sn5. The presence of Cu6Sn5 leads to a preferred formation of Cu2SnS3 via the reaction educts Cu2−xS and SnS2 in the presence of a SnS2(Cu4SnS6) melt. The melt phase may be advantageous in crystallising the kesterite, leading to enhanced grain growth in the presence of a liquid phase.},

abstract = {The present state of knowledge of structure, phase relations and metal ordering in 2(ZnX)x(CuBX2)1−x (B = Ga, In and X = S, Se, Te) and Cu2ZnxFe1−xSnS4 multinary compounds is discussed. The chemical disorder process in 2(ZnX)x(CuBX2)1−x alloys leads to a phase separation, i.e. in a certain composition range (2-phase field) two phases, tetragonal domains and a cubic matrix, coexist. Its width depends on the three-valent cation only and is independent from the size of anion. In the subsolidus region of the 2(ZnX)x(CuBX2)1−x system the stability range of tetragonal mixed crystals as well as the miscibility gap is decreasing, the stability range of cubic mixed crystals is increasing. The process of structural disorder in 2(ZnX)x(CuBX2)1−x as well as Cu2Fe1−xZnxSnS4 alloys is connected to the cation substructure. In tetragonal 2(ZnX)x(CuInX2)1−x alloys a non-random Zn distribution on the both cation positions of the chalcopyrite-type structure was revealed, whereas a random distribution of Zn and Cu on two different sites of the kesterite type structure was obtained in Cu2ZnSnS4 in contradiction to literature. The crossover from stannite (x=0) to kesterite (x=1) in Cu2Fe1−xZnxSnS4 is considered as a three-stage process of cation restructure involving Cu+, Zn2+ and Fe2+, whereas Sn4+ does not take part in this process. In tetragonal 2(ZnX)x(CuInX2)1−x alloys the anion displacement is decreasing with increasing ZnX content in CuInX2 indicating a decreasing tetragonal distortion. Here the disorder process in the cation substructure and the displacement process in the anion substructure are coupled.},

The calculated lattice parameters are in good agreement with experimental reported data. The elastic constants are calculated for both types of both compounds using the static finite strain scheme; the pressure dependence of elastic constants is predicted. The bulk modulus, anisotropy factor, shear modulus, Young’s modulus, Lame’s coefficient and Poisson’s ratio have been estimated from the calculated single crystalline elastic constants. The analysis of B/G ratio shows that Cu2ZnSnX4 or CZTX compounds behave as ductile. Through quasi-harmonic approximation, the temperature dependence of some thermodynamic functions and lattice heat capacity of both compounds for both types have been performed.},

Thereafter the book is concerned with the principles of operation of specific devices, beginning with the Gunn Diode and the p-n junction. The remaining chapters cover the on specific devices, including the LED, the bipolar transistor, the field-effect transistor, and the semiconductor laser. The book concludes with a chapter providing a brief introduction to quantum theory.Not overtly mathematical, Introduction to Semiconductor Device Physics introduces only those physical concepts required for an understanding of the semiconductor devices being considered. The author's intuitive style, coupled with an extensive set of worked problems, make this the ideal introductory text for those concerned with understanding electrical and electronic engineering, applied physics, and related subjects.},
