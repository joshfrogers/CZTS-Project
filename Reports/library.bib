Since 1992, when the book was first published, the field of thin films has expanded tremendously, especially with regard to technological applications. The second edition will bring the book up-to-date with regard to these advances. Most chapters have been greatly updated, and several new chapters have been added.},

The liquidus surface projection and an isothermal section at 670K were constructed. The existence of the quaternary compound Cu2ZnSnS8 was confirmed and the formation of another quaternary compound Cu2ZnSn3S8 was discovered in the system. Both compounds are analogous to the natural minerals stannine Cu2FeSnS4 and rhodostannine Cu2FeSn3S8; they crystallize in a tetragonal structure with lattice parameters a=0.543nm, c=1.085nm and a=0.5435(1) nm, c=1.0825(6) nm, respectively. The types of mono- and invariant reactions in the system and their coordinations were established.},

The addition of sugars impairs this transport in the diminishing hierarchy D-glucose, D-mannose, D-xylose, D-galactose, L-lyxose, D-araboascorbate, L-sorbose and 2-deoxy-D-ribose. The effect of glucose on transport of ascorbate is marked at physiological levels. Transport of DHA is accelerated by copper ion and allows dehydroascorbate to move against a concentration gradient. The evidence supports the hypotheses proposing that hyperglycemia will impair the intracellular availability of vitamin C.},
