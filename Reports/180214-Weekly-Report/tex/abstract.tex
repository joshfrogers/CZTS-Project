This report looks at the Ternary Phase Diagrams for the CZTS system, for both 600K and 900K temperatures. The Ternary Phase diagrams for these temperatures are found to be very similar to those at 300K, with the addition of some phases found to not stable at 300K.In addition to this, this report looks at the various methods of production used in research and industrial applications.
