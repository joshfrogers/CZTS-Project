As with the Ternary Phase Diagrams for 300K, the stable phases for 600K and 900K were calculated through examination of the tie-lines and subsequent crossing points. It was found that for 600K and 900K, there were more available phases for the Cu-Zn Binary alloy system, due to increased legibility of the binary alloy phase diagram for Cu-Zn. Unfortunately due to the location of these phases in relation to the CZTS Pseudo-Ternary Phase Diagram, these do not affect finding the location of CZTS. Though the Quaternary diagram for either 600K or 900K has not been fully constructed, it is hypothesized that the location of CZTS is not overly different from that found at 300K, because of the similarities between the Ternary Phase Diagrams at 600K/900K and 300K.

The Ternary Phase Diagrams produced for 600K are attached to the back of this report.
Data was acquired from the Thermochemical Properties of Inorganic Supplements Supplement \citep{barin_thermochemical_1977}, and the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics \citep{haynes_crc_2013}.
