Intro
-

History of solar cell tech
->Production and development of said technology over crystal structure

Reasons for drive for new technologies
-> Method of work in solar cells
-> Reasoning for rejected tech, as such req for new tech

History of CZTS - Diff composition, and difficulty in production
->Compositional problems, identification - Similar crystal structure
-> Advances with CZTS, Efficiency, current technologies
Possible use cases over trad tech.

PYTHON

Trick is not to attempt to assemble 4 ternary diagrams, but to project our current ones along a third dimension 
to a point - allowing us to take 'snapshot' ternary diagrams that could occur at various concentrations of a given element.

Knowing that we have Certain tie lines beginning and ending along this projection, allows quick pinpointing of where these 'snapshots' need to be.
